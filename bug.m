In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to properties declared with the `retain` or `copy` attributes.  If you don't properly balance retains and releases, memory leaks or crashes due to over-releasing can occur. This is often exacerbated when working with custom objects or complex data structures.
